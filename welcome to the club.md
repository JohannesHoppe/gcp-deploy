I am happy to see a new Deploy Builder. 😃👍

1. Please enable issues. There is a bug [here](https://github.com/wagnermaciel/gcp-deploy/blob/41de7a1ab7b1c1285cd14e8c2e292bfe3c4cee60/src/deploy/actions.ts#L49) and I can't contact you! see https://github.com/bikecoders/ngx-deploy-npm/issues/16
2. Please let me know when you're ready. I'll add you to the list of builders.

Regards,  
Johannes
